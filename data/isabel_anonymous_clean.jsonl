Note, though, that this would just allow me to set up\r\nforwarding.\r\n\nAnd I do think it is important\r\nthat we get this right, because once our site is public to the world (and\r\nmaybe this group is not looking at it / checking that everything is in\r\norder every day), we need to rely on software to make sure that everything\r\nis available and nothing breaks.\r\n\nI've been working on this with Maria, and I think we are close to a\r\nsolution, but it has not yet been implemented.
