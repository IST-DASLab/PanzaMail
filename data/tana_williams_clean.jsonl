Leslie/Mark will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly articulates IFCACorp's interests.  The second form should be used when IFCACorp is the only party disclosing confidential information.When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact Tana via email (tana.Williams@IFCACorp.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the following information: 1.  Which form you would like to use 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared 3.  Counterparty's legal name 4.  Counterparty's address 5.  Contact name at Counterparty 6.

As soon as they receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for re-approval."}
{"email": "Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting IFCACorp entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power.2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts on this? I guess IFCACorpOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not approve the London based counterparties.3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by London when they arrive for work Friday morning."}

{"email": "I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell you what a good job he has been doing for our group.I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly respond to our client, the online trading group.Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us meet the needs of our clients.Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a valuable asset to your team!"}
{"email": "On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction IFCACorpOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it up to me."}
{"email": "I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and the products such counterparties are approved to trade.  Additionally, at the bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from the original approval lists.As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will delete them.I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, so this database may evolve over time.The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike Neves:  Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself).  Let me know if you have change access by mistake.On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database confidential to the group we have granted view access to. Do not forward this email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.  Much thanks!"}

Have your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole range of IFCACorpOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?

{"email": "This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we had them open for power sales only on the pre-approval list.  When I checked Profile Manager, it had them open for east & west power, transact on BOTH the bid and offer.  Do you still want them to do power sales only?  Both east & west?"}
{"email": "ANP Marketing Company has faxed in their PA and ETA amendment and we should get the originals in by fedex today.  They are hot to trade ERCOT online, and I don't know if they can trade it or not, but if we could move them up to the top of the credit review list they would be most happy."}

Per my conv. w/the online team, we going to have to have them come in thru both Houston and London as a counterparty (we haven't solved multibranch customers online).  With Edmund out, I need someone to email me your Electronic Trading Agreement and Password Application so we can send them to the lawyer we are negotiating the ISDA Master with.  Can you have someone there send me the docs.Much thanks..."}

{"email": "Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank into their own subdirectory called \"Swap Forms\" (look it up just like a person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't know if you can access other subdirectories.We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms directory.Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up."}

It's got the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell us, IFCACorp North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT International).  Sorry..."}

When I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a different path.Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I am adding drop downs for \"approved for online trading\", so you will be able to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in terms of the financial contacts.I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I hope this is helpful!"}

I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the IFCACorp Net Works Team and my proposed form for the IFCACorpOffline Team.  Please let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people you would like the list circulated to.2.  All future requests for NDAs for the IFCACorpOffline Team should be directed to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for IFCACorpOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I prepare many other NDAs for IFCACorp Net Works).  At the request of the dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she has prepared that should be added to the list.If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please call me at x33399."}

{"email": "Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades and master sit."}
{"email": "Just wanted to give you a head's up.  We received last night from ED&F Man their form of proposed Clearing Agreement with the OMLX.  It appears they simultaneously sent it to the OMLX.  I am having my assistant fax a copy to you.  I haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'll do that first thing this morning.  As you recall, we sent them the OMLX's form for signature a few weeks ago, and they've now come back with their form.  I don't know how customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look at it here and give you a call."}

{"email": "Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in October?  Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs of masters to have in place.  I don't think we want either master to be the survivor master.  With Chase we have an old 1987 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  Yuk, yuk.  If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.  I know it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master replaced by October.  Do you think that's do-able?  Do we have a contact at Chase/Morgan we can start dealing with?  I'm going to add chase to the Legal/Credit list just as a tickler for us to get this thing rolling."}

The only good news is we arrive 1/2 hour early!The weather was so warm in Houston that we had to turn the air on in the car.  It cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters.  When I got home I spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where I moved them for the freeze that never arrived.  That's one thing I hate about Houston winters, you can never count on it staying cold so I have to keep moving the plants in and out.  After that, I aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter box.  Then I ordered in Chinese and read three days of newspapers.  Very relaxing!

I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you have an assistant do that.Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty).  Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at it just to see what I'm doing.We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not fully operational yet.

The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.If you have any questions, please call."}

{"email": "I would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?Anything else special you think I need to mention?"}

It appears the date Fred signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing contractual documents without Legal's initials.There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:  (1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more after lunch.On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign off on that change.

My given task when I compiled this list was to identify \"utilities\" and determine if there was a reason we should not approve online trading for the counterparty.  We originally denied approval for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding commercial reason to transact.  We are now taking the position that investor owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for trading.  However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  Obviously, if you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us know.  In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian counterparties.  We will run those by Canadian counsel.Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.  You may ignore the \"Approved for Trading\" column.For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could not locate  information from any of the other sources.Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly."}

The biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading will take place).

It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.

Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life.

London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US and UK counterparties.With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me."}

We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your attention. One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.  The Houston forms are currently located in a \"read-only\" directory.  We need to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms evolve without  approval.Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation change, if you make it in every agreement.Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical component of the Fishkin Project).Thanks for your attention to this."}

Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.Most of IFCACorp's litigation work is done out of IFCACorp  They do have a big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the IFCACorp companies.Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more options in other groups.As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.

With the governmental, the proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let me know and I'll send you down the revisions.By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not include the reps and warranties required to transact with such counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first."}

The only information we need to continue to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and Credit have access to the Portland General masters.Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading issues.

{"email": "Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house.  I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his additional time or money on.  To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you pay."}

{"email": "Mark asked me to get your input regarding a Canadian form question.  We have the following language in the Canadian ISDA Agreements:Limitation of Rate.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the Default Rate, Non-default Rate, or Termination Rate exceed the maximum non-usurious interest rate, if any, that at any time or from time to time may be contracted for, taken, reserved, charged, or received on the subject indebtedness under the law applicable to such party.   For the purpose of disclosure pursuant to the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to the above highlighted language?Thanks for your help."}

I got some good bargains on post winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one sitting!My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis fountain.  He's just lovely!Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of the 4th of July holiday.You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.

Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with me on this?"}
{"email": "There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's contracting party is usually IFCACorp North America Corp. and London's contracting party is usually IFCACorp Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.  We cannot do business under each others' financial master agreements for legal and tax reasons.ENA and IFCACorp Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went away.  Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons)."}

As we all know, because of the legal issues that arose out of the \"Orange County\" litigation, no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and an ISDA Master is in place.   Also, besides the usual issues surround the governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions, we also need to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 10 year w/o prior voter approval.Credit, if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me I will prepare a draft ASAP and Sara will review it.

Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.

{"email": "Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to your email I have the following comments:1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.  Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.  All their  trades must be done by telephone.2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and Aspect.4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master."}

Further, it will be OK if the confirmations go out as \"Nicor Gas Company\" even though the masters may be under one of the above names.PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, this should be considered an exception to the rule.

Since transacting these currency transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to rely solely on the \"Restrictions\" contained in Lotus Notes."}

It wasclear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though amuch higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at thepress conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film ofthe Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced theYankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. \"The fact remains thatsome of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit,\" said the Metsbatting coach. \"The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees arecelebrating prematurely.\"Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast ofall the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by theumpires of each game. \"While some of the strikes called against the Metswere, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome ofthe World Series,\" the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legalclaim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually wonthe World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.\"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees,\" saida Mets spokesman.  \"The World Series crown is rightly ours.\"The manager ofthe Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light joggingfor exercise.  He has stated that he believes \"we need to let the processrun its course without a rush to judgment.\""}

{"email": "Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the messenger)...With respect to your form of online GTC:It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty (a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with IFCACorp Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online \"Deemed ISDA\" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own form of confirmation). As you can see when you look at our \"Deemed ISDA\" form of confirmation, there are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation includes, such as authority and tax representations, \"arm's length transaction\" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting \"in respect of the same transaction\"), no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, definition of \"Transaction\" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, \"Website\" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we usually say \"Loss\" instead of \"Market Quotation\", also,  Market Quotation and Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we need the word \"integrated\" with respect to the rerenced that the documents contain a \"single agreement\" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our \"severability\" and \"setoff\" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, business day defined as Sydney only, etc.Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in place.I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help resolving all these issues..."}
{"email": "Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.  The two issues out of the meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were:1.  Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.  Per our discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus.  There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going to do.  Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts.2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a \"B\" approved GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to him.  I guess the physical people are OK with that.  I don't know what discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want to have this confirmed for him.Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.

They signed accepting joint and several liability with respect to the obligations.

{"email": "Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.  You may have read in the papers about our new IFCACorp Online, our new web based commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.IFCACorpOnline.com.  Mark has been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and trading restrictions.As far as my \"Fishkin\" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking at, some we found out IFCACorp already has.    Mark and I are discussing what we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our thoughts soon. Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put this database together and start loading the information.So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!P.S.  Thanks for the article!"}
{"email": "I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware,  since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based segments as we add them in the future."}

{"email": "I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall \"system\" still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the database to all interested ENA employees.  I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.   First is our\" jurisdictional database\", which will summarize the swap laws as they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start briefing the country information soon.Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might be more of a problem.The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces before the overall system. Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this."}

{"email": "David,Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the Australian agreements plugged into the system.This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort on the counterparty front.In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract records and approval for online trading.For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have found helpful.You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good time for me to do a full review of this database with you."}

{"email": "FYIPer Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at Cadwalader to determine if using the word \"exchange\" in a corporation's name would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word \"exchange\" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in using \"exchange\" in your corporate name, however, putting \"exchange\" in a company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea."}

{"email": "I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you usually do?"}

{"email": "As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not all of the products it wants to trade).When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the European products, including specifically European physical power products (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone up for unless we really mean it.So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down for European physical power."}

{"email": "It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product on IFCACorpOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it wasn't being sold by a Japan based IFCACorp company, so my understanding was that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online approvals.The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade US bandwidth segments.P.S. we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list."}
{"email": "Clem,Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.  Carolyn started working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of IFCACorp!).  Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB relationship for the law firm.Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be around.  I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.  I think she would be a great asset to your team and IFCACorp. - cpv.doc"}
{"email": "The revised form of ISDA exhibit.doc (which contains the credit support annex and letter of credit forms) has been moved into the attorney forms bank under atty.fms/current forms/isdaexh.doc.  The old form of ISDAexh.doc is now under \"old forms\" in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldISDAexh.doc.  Again, per my last email, the revised Multicurrency Schedule is already in attorney forms.  You may want to circulate blacklined drafts.  The Index to the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your reference for the most current forms.  It is called \"formlist.doc.\"London and Singapore, FYI, in addition to making changes to the ISDA collateral annex, we made changes to the MAC definitions (which we inserted into ISDAexh.doc for ease of the paralegals) and made changes to the letter of credit terms, as well as the form of Letter of Credit.   We also added in an alternative \"Credit Support Amount\" provision on the front page of the ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement.We moved the guaranty forms (IFCACorp and Counterparty) as a separate document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc.  The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed the procedures for timing of demands made on IFCACorp (deleting the 15 day period).  We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the IFCACorp guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.We are close to finalizing changes to the Industrial Master, as well as making changes to the Omnibus form of confirmation.Also, by the end of the day I will have moved our standard forms of Secretary's Certificates into the attorney forms bank."}

I've finally put in central air, repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in a construction site.I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll probably have to go through it again this winter.

I am totally unfamiliar with the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it sounds like a utility or governmental.Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?"}

But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover (and clean from my construction work).I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast and dinner included!  Such a deal!  I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them yet.What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things going on?"}
