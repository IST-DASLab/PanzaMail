I have read it carefully, and would\r\nhave a few notes:\r\n\r\n- First, the main findings seem generally valid in my experience, so it's nice to have them distilled in very clear form.\r\n- However, for the comparison, specifically generation, I\r\nthink that it would be have been nice to compare with \"state-of-the-art\"\r\n techniques.\r\n- One other variable that could be accounted for in more detail is how much\r\ncomputation the user is willing to invest into the process. In\r\nCAP (above) you can see that with 50% of the budget used for\r\nfinetuning one can reach 80-90% savings almost losslessly. Taking\r\nthis to the extreme, our work shows that one can reach highly-accurate networks with low accuracy drops (1-2%) provided enough compute is spent.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am aware that this short \"critique\" is biased towards my area\r\n(and towards our own work), but I thought it might be useful to have this\r\nperspective as well.\r\n\r\nIn any case, very nice work, and hopefully see you at the conference!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid", "subject": "Your recent work"}

{"email": "Yes, that sounds great. I've put some talk details below.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nDavid\r\nTitle: Accurate Deep Learning at Scale\r\nSpeaker: David Keys \r\n\r\n*Abstract: *A key barrier to the wide deployment of highly-accurate machine\r\nlearning models, whether for language or vision, is their high\r\ncomputational and memory overhead. Although we possess the mathematical\r\ntools for highly-accurate compression of such models, these\r\ntheoretically-elegant techniques require second-order information of the\r\nmodel\u2019s loss function, which is hard to even approximate efficiently at the\r\nscale of billion-parameter models.In this talk, I will describe our work on\r\nbridging this computational divide, which enables the accurate second-order\r\npruning and quantization of models at truly massive scale. Compressed using\r\nour techniques, models with billions and even trillions of parameters can\r\nbe executed efficiently on a few GPUs, with significant speedups, and\r\nnegligible accuracy loss.\r\n\r\n", "subject": "Re: Potential visit"}
